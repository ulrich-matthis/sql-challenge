# sql-challenge

Objective: For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, 
and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Using provided csv files, they were imported into created tables using PostgreSQL and PGAdmin4 and then queried to the specific question,
which are included as comments within the SQL queries file. Relationships amongst the table are also provided in a code format as
well as with a diagram for easier viewing.

All CSV files used for this assignment are available witin the Data folder.
