# sql-challenge

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Using provided csv files, they were imported into created tables using PostgreSQL and PGAdmin4 and then queried to the specific question,
which are included as comments within the SQL queries file.

title_id changed to emp_title in titles csv for simplification of data in this SQL analysis
